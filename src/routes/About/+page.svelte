    This is Candy - a Free and Open Source Discord user app designed to make the Discord experience better.
</p>
<h2>
    Why does this exist?
</h2>
<p>
    I created Candy because I wanted to a) learn more about how discord user apps work and b) make the Discord experience better for myself and others.
</p>
<h2>
    Can I self host / modify this?
</h2>
<p>
    Yes! Candy doesn't have any form of license attached to its source code <a href="https://github.com/NotPiny/Candy?tab=readme-ov-file#license" target="_blank">(apart from this)</a>. You can find the source code at <a href="https://github.com/NotPiny/Candy" target="_blank">NotPiny/Candy on GitHub</a> the readme should have all the information you need to get started under the <a href="https://github.com/NotPiny/Candy?tab=readme-ov-file#developer-stuff" style="color: white;" target="_blank"><code>Developer stuff</code> heading</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    The details behind the app
</h2>
<p>
    Candy is built using <a href="https://discord.js.org" target="_blank">discord.js</a> and <a href="https://axios-http.com/" target="_blank">axios</a>. That's it. It's meant to be simple and easy to work with. The official Candy bot is hosted on <a href="https://daalbot.xyz">DaalBot's</a> server as well I don't want to buy another server just for this.
</p>
<h2>
    How can I contribute?
</h2>
<p>
    Like said in the readme on the GitHub repo, you can contribute by making a pull request with your changes. And I will review them as soon as I can. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in <a href="https://go.daalbot.xyz/HQ">DaalBot's support server</a>.

<h2>
    Why the name "Candy"?
</h2>
<p>
    <!-- svelte-ignore a11y-no-static-element-interactions -->
    To be honest, I don't really know. I came up with it when I was thinking of a new name for my twitch bot and decided to go with <span id="cndy-is-cindy" on:mouseenter={() => {
        if (browser) {
            heartHover = true;
            tryAlert('Fun fact: It\'s real name is actually Cindy', 2.5 * 1000);

            const ele = document.getElementById('cndy-is-cindy');
            if (!ele) return;

            ele.style.color = '#d2d2d2';
        }
    }}
    on:mouseleave={() => {
        if (browser) {
            heartHover = false;

            const ele = document.getElementById('cndy-is-cindy');
            if (!ele) return;

            ele.style.color = '#fff';
        }
    }}>CndyBot</span> (used to be DaalBotT). Which was the inspiration for the whole app so why not keep the name?
</p>
<h2>
    Okay cool cool, but what the hell is DaalBot and why do you keep mentioning it?
</h2>
<p>
    Well thank you for asking (even though you didn't). DaalBot is a Discord bot that I made and maintain. It's a general purpose bot designed to be infinitely customisable and is how Candy was born. You can find out more about DaalBot at <a href="https://daalbot.xyz" target="_blank">daalbot.xyz</a>.
